The [MCP Server](docs/reference/architecture.md#application) for Relevance Studio implements all [REST API](docs/reference/rest-api.md) endpoints as MCP Tools. You can refer to the REST API documentation to see the capabilities and requirements of each respective MCP tool.

All MCP tool endpoints accept payloads as JSON and return payloads as JSON (`application/json`).
